// Needs you, highest first: each card entering it gets a criticality — local rules for the obvious
// ones, Haiku for the rest, in one call for all the newcomers. A priority I set (👤) is never
// re-rated; Haiku's (🤖) is cleared when the card leaves, so its next visit is rated afresh.
// Fail open: no answer is `normal` — a wrong rank only costs order, never safety.

- low: cosmetic, or can wait days

Answer with a JSON array, one {"priority": "urgent" | "high" | "normal" | "low", "reason": "<one short line>"} per task, in order, and nothing else.

  )
  .join('\n\n')}`
