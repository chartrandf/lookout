  # The build is ad-hoc signed but not notarized, and the downloaded DMG arrives quarantined (the
  # flag propagates to everything copied out of the mounted image), so Gatekeeper would block the
  # first launch. Clear it here — a third-party tap has to be `brew trust`ed to run this, which is
  # the consent that makes it acceptable.
