A desktop cockpit for your GitHub pull request workflow: the PRs waiting on your review, your own PRs waiting on someone else's, and the agent sessions behind them — one board for both sides of the table.

Lookout watches the local git repos you select, discovers open PRs you haven't reviewed yet, and keeps each card's whole history together. Dispatch a review or a follow-up from the card, resume the session later, and let the board follow GitHub.

No remote server — everything runs locally: the app polls `gh`, reads Claude/OpenCode sessions and keeps its state in SQLite locally. The bundled `lookout` CLI writes to that same database, so a skill or script can move a card from a terminal whether or not the app is open.

> The flow is yours: action buttons dispatch the prompts you write in **Settings → Review actions** / **Pull Request actions**.

## Usage

1. **Settings** — add local clone paths; `owner/repo` is detected from each clone's git origin. Your GitHub login is auto-detected; your own PRs are never listed.
2. **Discovery** — new open PRs land here. **Review** (add to board + dispatch `/review`), **Watch** (add to board), **Ignore** (hide forever). PRs you already reviewed or commented on skip Discovery.
3. **Reviews** — Watching / Needs Review / Reviewed / Follow-up / Done. Drag cards to triage or prioritize. Merged or closed PRs auto-move to Done and drop off after 24 h.
4. **Pull Requests** — your own PRs: Waiting / In Review / Ready to merge / Done. A human review moves a card to In Review, an approval to Ready to merge (where the CI tag is all you need to decide). Cards only ever move *forward* on their own, so re-requesting a review or flipping back to draft can't drop one out of In Review. Bot reviews (Cursor, Sonar) show a 🤖 badge but never move a card — they're lint, not review. Drag anywhere, in either direction: a drop stays put until GitHub itself changes its mind. Done holds what you merged or closed today and empties overnight.
5. **PR panel** — click a card: chat-style history (sessions, reports, commits, reviews), dispatch buttons, stage selector, one-click approve when follow-up is all green, resume sessions in Ghostty.
6. **Worktrees** — you only ever register the clone path. A branch checked out in a linked worktree is followed there: actions run in that worktree, its sessions and `AI_TASKS/code-review/` reports show up on the card, and resume opens the directory the session actually ran in.

## Install

### Manual

Grab the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/chartrandf/lookout/releases) (universal — Apple Silicon + Intel) and drag **Lookout** to Applications.

On **Linux** (x86_64), grab the `.deb` (`sudo apt install ./Lookout_*.deb`) or the `.AppImage` (`chmod +x`, then run it).

### Homebrew

This repo doubles as its own Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap chartrandf/lookout https://github.com/chartrandf/lookout
brew trust --cask chartrandf/lookout/lookout   # Homebrew 6+ gates third-party casks
brew install --cask lookout                    # --force to replace a hand-installed copy
```

> All three lines are required, in order. Homebrew expands a bare `chartrandf/lookout` to
> `chartrandf/homebrew-lookout`, which doesn't exist — so not even the fully-qualified
> `brew install --cask chartrandf/lookout/lookout` can tap this repo on its own. Skip the `brew tap`
> line and you get `Invalid usage: Casks must be fully-qualified` / `No Cask with this name exists`.

### 🔒 Quarantine Issue

The bundle is self-signed, so macOS quarantines it. You may need to release the quarantine manually from the Terminal.

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Lookout.app
```

## Dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

`pnpm tauri …` builds the CLI first (`pretauri` → `pnpm build:cli`): `tauri.conf.json` bundles
`dist-cli/lookout.mjs` as a resource, and the Rust build fails without it.

Requirements — see [Tauri's prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS:

- **Linux** — the webview/tray system libs, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu:
  `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev`
- **Rust** (stable) — `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`. Without it
  `pnpm tauri dev` dies at `cargo metadata … No such file or directory (os error 2)`.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS) — `xcode-select --install`, for the linker `cargo` shells out to.
- **`gh`** (authenticated) and a coding-agent CLI — **`claude`** (the default) or **`opencode`**.

pnpm is pinned by the `packageManager` field — `corepack enable` picks up the right version.
`npm install` can't build this tree: `package-lock.json` is stale, and resolving the missing dev
deps from scratch crashes Arborist with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`.

## Reviews with no report file

A review only reaches a card if something wrote it down. My own `/do-review` exports
`AI_TASKS/code-review/<stamp>-<branch>.md`, which the app scans — but the default review button runs
Claude Code's own `/review`, which prints its verdict and saves nothing. Those cards used to show a
session and no review.

Lookout now reads the review back out of the session transcript itself (the final assistant turn) and
keeps it for 30 days. Follow-up runs are captured the same way and labelled as follow-ups. It is display only: a captured review never moves a card and never raises an
alert. **Settings → Capture reviews** has the switch, the count and a Clear button.

A branch whose reviews *are* exported to `AI_TASKS/code-review/` is left alone — the file is used and
nothing is captured, so a review can't appear twice. A session that wrote its own report is skipped
for the same reason.

Capture happens on the next sync. For it to land the moment a session stops, copy the Stop hook from
Settings into `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "hooks": { "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "lookout review capture --hook", "timeout": 10 }] }] } }
```

A skill can also hand a review over outright, which always wins over what Lookout guessed:

```bash
lookout review report --file AI_TASKS/reviews/pr-2305.md   # a report file living anywhere
claude -p "…" | lookout review report --stdin              # or the text itself
```

## `lookout` CLI

The Homebrew cask puts a `lookout` command on your PATH — `brew install --cask lookout` symlinks it,
nothing else to do. Installing the DMG by hand instead leaves it inside the bundle at
`Lookout.app/Contents/Resources/lookout`; symlink it yourself:

```bash
ln -sf /Applications/Lookout.app/Contents/Resources/lookout ~/.local/bin/lookout
```

It runs on Node 22.13+ (or 23.4+), where `node:sqlite` stopped needing a flag. In a dev checkout:
`pnpm build:cli`, then symlink `dist-cli/lookout.mjs`. It moves cards from a terminal, so a Claude Code skill can
report back once it has pushed comments — and it works whether or not the app is open, because it
writes the same SQLite database the app uses.

The command name says whose work it is: **`review`** for other people's PRs (the review pipeline),
**`mine`** for your own (the merge pipeline).

```bash
lookout review list --stage "in review"    # what's in a column
lookout review show --pr 2305              # one card, or omit the selector inside a repo checkout
lookout review reviewed                    # the PR for this repo + branch → Reviewed
lookout review comments-pushed --count 3   # what /do-review calls after `gh api .../reviews`
lookout review report --file report.md     # register a report your skill wrote, wherever it wrote it
lookout review capture --hook              # Stop-hook entry point: payload on stdin, always silent

lookout mine list --column ready           # my PRs that are approved and just need a CI check
lookout mine show                          # my PR for this repo + branch
lookout mine ready                         # → Ready to merge

lookout doctor                             # database path and both board counts
```

Stages and columns are named the way the board names them — `needs-review`, `"In Review"`,
`follow-up`, `"Ready to merge"`, case and spacing ignored. Retired names still resolve (`inbox` is
now `needs_review`, and `lookout card …` is the old spelling of `lookout review …`), so older
scripts and shell aliases keep working.

A card is picked by `--id <id>`, `--pr <n>` or `--branch <b>` (add `--repo owner/repo` to
disambiguate); with no selector at all it uses the current checkout's origin and branch. Moves on
both boards are forward-only — the app's own rule, so an automated caller can't drag a card
backwards — with `--force` to override. `--json` for machine output, `--dry-run` to resolve without
writing.

Exit codes are the contract for scripts: `0` done · `1` error · `2` no matching card · `3` Lookout
has never run here · `4` selector matched several cards. In a skill, guard on the binary and let the
"nothing to do" codes pass:

```bash
command -v lookout >/dev/null && lookout review comments-pushed --branch "$BRANCH" --count 3 --quiet || true
```

When the app is running it repaints immediately: the CLI pings a unix socket the app publishes next
to the database, and the app re-reads. The event is only a hint — every failure degrades to the app
noticing at its next sync.
